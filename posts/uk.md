### Black History in the UK
Research some of the key events in Black British history:
- [1919 Race Riots](https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/events-global-african-history/britain-s-1919-race-riots/) — one of Britain’s most violent periods of racial upheaval in the 20th century.
- [League of Coloured Peoples](https://blogs.soas.ac.uk/archives/2018/10/26/black-history-month-2018-harold-moody) — British civil-rights organisation established in 1931 by Jamaican-born Dr Harold Moody with the goal of racial equality.
- [1948 British Nationality Act](https://www.runnymedetrust.org/blog/british-citizenship-and-the-windrush-generation) — 

### Criminal Justice System
Read the stories of some of the many British people of colour who’ve been abused, killed and/or otherwise failed by the British Criminal Justice System (CJS):
- **Sarah Reed** — a 32-year-old with a serious mental health condition exacerbated by the death of her baby and an assault by a police officer. She took her own life in prison, and a jury concluded that “unacceptable delays in psychiatric assessment and failures in care contributed to her death”. I urge you to read the [conclusions from the inquest findings](https://www.inquest.org.uk/sarah-reed-inquest-conclusions).  
- **Rashan Charles** —  a 20-year-old who was pursued as he fled after a vehicle stop, thrown to the ground and restrained, and subsequently choked to death on a caffeine and paracetamol pill he had in his mouth. The officer said he and his “fellow officers were on the lookout for gang violence” and he had “believed [Rashan Charles] to be acting suspiciously” ([read more in this article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/rashan-charles-inquest-cctv-showing-his-arrest-upsets-family)).  An independent investigation found that the officer hadn’t followed protocol by failing to call am ambulance sooner, but declared the use of force justified. The officer faced no charges and was granted anonymity. 
- **Julian Cole** — a 19-year-old student who was left paralysed and brain damaged after having his neck broken while being tackled by police and cuffed face down, when he had been trying to demand a refund after having been thrown out of a nightclub. The police officers involved were later found to have lied in their statements and directly to Cole’s family about what had happened. They were dismissed, but no criminal charges were brought against them.
- Belly Mujinga, Adrian McDonald, Daniel Adewole, Azelle Rodney, Derek Bennett, Sheku Bayoh and the many other. 

Know that these are individual stories which are symptomatic of systemic issues, plainly visible in the figures.
- [Race and the criminal justice system statistics 2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/race-and-the-criminal-justice-system-statistics-2018)
	- Black people make up less than 5% of the UK population but 13% of the prison population.
	- White people make up 59% of the London population while black people make up 12%. Yet the proprtion of stop and searches is identical for both groups at 37%.
	- Black defendants receive an average custodial sentence of 28 months for indictable offences. White defendents receive on average a 18.3 months sentence  (lower than all other ethnic groups). 
	- 6% of black UK adults were a victim of a personal crime in 2018/19, compared to 4.2% of white adults. (And that's not accounting for the fact that Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups are more reluctant to come forward and report a crime in the first place for fear of experiencing prejudice, and lack of trust in the system being fair.)
	- In homocide victims who are children, 17.5% are black as opposed to 10.6% who are white.
	- This report says that "minority ethnic groups appear to be over-represented at many stages" and the "greatest disparity appears at the point of stop and search, arrests, custodial sentencing and prison population." But it does not explore any of the other factros that play a role, and it makes no mention of any investigation into the CJS's own biases or practices.
*Note: Exact population statistics can be quite tricky to ascertain, as a lot of the data pulls from the 2011 census, which is obviously 9 years out of date now. However, even if these figures aren't 100% accurate, the patterns are evident.*
- [Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic disproportionality in the Criminal Justice System in England and Wales](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/639261/bame-disproportionality-in-the-cjs.pdf) (2016)
	- BAME young males and adults are more likely than the white group to be arrested.
	- BAME males, both youth and adults, and BAME women are all more likely to be tried at the Crown Court compared to the white group.
	-  BAME adults, both male and female, are more likely to receive custodial sentences at the Crown Court compared to the white group.
- [The Lammy Review](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf) — an independent 2017 review of racial bias and BAME representation in the CJS which concludes that there is both overt and covert racial prejudice and unconscious or implicit bias within the CJS. Findings include:
	- Those from BAME groups were three times as likely to be stopped and searched as those who are White. Those who are Black were over six times more likely to be stopped
	- Young black men were more than 10 times more likely to be arrested for drug offences than their white counterparts.
	- BAME defendants were more likely than white defendants to receive prison sentences for drug offences.
- The Metropolitan police officers enforcing the coronavirus lockdown are more than twice as likely to issue fines to black people as to white people ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research)).


Read [Racism and criminal justice](https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/publications/cjm/article/racism-and-criminal-justice) published in the 2015 #BlackLivesMatter edition of cjm. It explores the social and historical context to disproportionality in the criminal justice system, and highlights that:
- The data doesn't support claims by politicans like Tony Blair that this is down to "black on black" crime.
- Racism, surveillance and societal systems create problems and barriers for BAME groups. Black people experience the problem, but they aren't the problem.
- The mainstream understanding that criminal justice "picks up the most dangerous individuals in society" and "protects victims" is false. It protects against some threats, but not necessarily the most grave ones, and is self-interested in where it focuses its efforts.
- Criminal justice does not operate in a bubble. There are many interconnected factors and inequalities that play a role in the disproporionate punishment of BAME people. There is a need to "push for change within criminal justice and outside of criminal justice".
