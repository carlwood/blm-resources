If your schooling was anything like ours, then there are a ton of events and people you never learnt about that are part of British history (and, like us, you may have never taken it upon yourself to learn until now).

[The Black Curriculum](https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/) is an organisation working to make Black History mandatory in schools, and you can [email the Education Secretary](https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/action) to put pressure on the government to make this change.

## Events in UK history
This is an extremely non-exhaustive list of some historical events we're in the process of educating ourselves about:

- **The Slave Trade in Britain and around the Empire.** In 1807, the [Slave Trade Act](http://abolition.e2bn.org/slavery_113.html) abolished the slave trade in the British Empire, however the practice itself was not actually abolished until the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, when slaves were emancipated and the British government paid compensation to slave owners for "loss of property" totaling £20 million — a debt that was still being paid off by UK taxpayers [until 2015](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/680456/FOI2018-00186_-_Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833_-_pdf_for_disclosure_log__003_.pdf). The [National Archive](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/slavery-or-slave-owners/) links to and explains how to search the registers (though no public records were kept prior to 1812).
- During the [1919 Race Riots](https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/events-global-african-history/britain-s-1919-race-riots/) — one of Britain’s most violent periods of racial upheaval in the 20th century — 
- 1931 establishment of the [League of Coloured Peoples](https://blogs.soas.ac.uk/archives/2018/10/26/black-history-month-2018-harold-moody) — British civil-rights organisation established by Jamaican-born Dr Harold Moody with the goal of racial equality.
- [1948 British Nationality Act](https://www.runnymedetrust.org/blog/british-citizenship-and-the-windrush-generation) — 
- 1948 SS Empire Windrush arrives at Tilbury
- 1958 uprisings in London and Nottingham
- 1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act
- 1958-1966 Notting Hill Carnival begins (exact date is disputed)
- 1963 Bristol bus boycott
- 1965, 1968 and 1975 Race Relations Acts
- 1967 British Black Panther party established
- 1970 Trial of the Mangrove Nine
- 1979 Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure (led to repeal of the ‘Sus laws’)
- 1981 Brixton uprisings and Lord Scarman report
- 1999 [Macpherson Report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277111/4262.pdf) published — an in-depth inquiry into the matters arising from the racially-motivated murder of Stephen Lawrence and the subsequent invesigation. The report concludes that there is "no doubt but that there were fundamental errors" and makes 70 recommendations ([summarised here](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12)).
