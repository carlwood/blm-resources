It's tempting to jump straight to action and educating yourself (and both are crucial!), but part of the work of becoming antiracist is to look inwards. If you're white, as I am, this includes:

- Ackowledging white privilege and how we benefit from it, at the expense of people of colour
- Thinking about the ways in which we've perpetuated racism through our actions or inaction
- Identifying the gaps in our education or awareness, and working out how to fill them in

Here are some the lessons I've learnt so far from listening to black creators and activists (linked wherever applicable so you can read and listen to them directly):

- Nice does not equal antiracist. ([@rachel.cargle](https://www.instagram.com/rachel.cargle/))
- If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. (Desmond Tutu quote, shared by many) 
- If it's a choice between not doing it at all and getting it wrong. Get it wrong. Learn from it. Do better next time. ([@officialmillennialblack](https://www.instagram.com/officialmillennialblack/))
- You don't have to pretend to be free of racism to be an anti-racist. Anti-racism is the commitment to fight racism wherever you find it, including in yourself. ([@IjeomaOluo](https://twitter.com/ijeomaoluo/status/1150565193832943617?lang=en))
- Do this work yourself! Don't expect black people to be responsible for telling you what you could or should be doing.

I really recommend watching [@ivirlei's](https://www.instagram.com/ivirlei/) IGTV *White Women who Truly Want to Help: Here's how*. Here are some of my key takeaways from it (but please watch her video):

- **Our work needs to start with deep self-reflection.** Before we can take meaningful action, we need to have the difficult conversations with ourselves, and ask: "If I'm only just now realising that I need to take action, then what have I been ignoring up until now? What are the parts of myself that have supported racism?" This work will be uncomfortable and it's a process that can take years or a lifetime, but it's *critical*. 
- **Our action needs to begin at home.** We have to commit to being the very vocal white friend and family member, who calls out racism wherever we see it. This isn't an easy position to take, so we need to get comfortable being uncomfortable. We can't let fear or discomfort stop us. We need to create a new identity for ourselves as someone who will never allow racist comments or behaviour to go unchallenged. 
- **We need to do things beyond simply educate ourselves.** By all means we should read books and watch documentaries, but if we're not actively applying any of it in the real world, it's not enough. Stand up for people. If we think "Who am I to try and make a difference?", who aren't you?! We have a voice and influence. We can talk to people. We can raise our children to not be passive when it comes to racism.

On the point of self-reflection, I realise the flurry of action I've taken over the past week (including reading books, sharing posts, donating, signing petitions, and even creating this site) is very likely at least partly a form of distraction from having to sit with the discomfort I feel as a result of not having done these things before now. There's much work to do, and no quick fixes. 

And on that topic, I really recommend watching [@brandonkgood's](https://www.instagram.com/brandonkgood/) IGTV *To My White Friends: Guilt, Shame, Embarrassment*. Again, here's a summary of some of what he says, but please watch his video: 

- **The embarrassment, guilt and shame is connected to our identity as a "good person".** We consider ourselves to be kind, loving and empathetic, and if those things are true, how could we have gone this long without actively challenging racism? We're feeling discomfort because we realise that, through our silence and inaction, we have been supporting and perpetuating racism. We're now seeing that we are in fact racist, and our identity as a good person is being challenged as a result.
- **Understand that being an ally is messy and complicated.** It's natural that these negative feelings will come up, but it's what we do with them that counts. We need to connect with white friends and family and talk about it openly, and ask "how the fuck did it take us this long to wake up?" We must not unload this onto the black people in our lives. It is not for them to comfort us, or ease our guilt.
- **Feeling this way is an essential part of the work.** We need to sit with it and reflect deeply. We need to force ourselves to confront all the times we thought or did something racist. All the times we made assumptions about people based on racial stereoytpes. All the times we were silent and didn't challenge racism. And then, we need to do better.

## A note on social media use

Here are a few more things to consider specifically when using social media. I'm writing these as reminders for myself first and foremost.

- Do your research before taking action, and make sure you're not causing inadvertent harm (like with the #blacklivesmatter "don't break the chain" story or the Black Out Tuesday posts on Instagram). Take some time to listen to what black people are saying about it. Ultimately, go with your gut, but don't do something just because it's trending if it doesn't actually help fight racism in any meaningful way.
- Be mindful of who you're amplifying. There are lots of well-intentioned non-black people sharing useful links or quotes from black people, but rather than re-post these second-hand sources, take the time to seek out the original source and amplify those instead.
- Ask yourself if your post is actually helping the cause, or if it's more to alleviate your own guilt or make you look like a good person. Posting about how heartbroken you are doesn't help black people, and it can actually cause harm.
- By all means post publicly, but you should be doing at least as much work if not much more offline. Reading, self-reflecting, etc. Aim to do more learning and listening than talking.
- Diversify who you're following and pay attention to what they share — this is a change you can bed into your everyday life, and will help keep antiracism at the forefront of your mind even after the murder of George Floyd is no longer something people are talking about everyday. This is now a life-long mission.
- You can go back to sharing your "regular" type of content if you choose, but make antiracism a part of it. Allow it to infuse everything you do and become part of your identity. You likely already stood for something before this. Now make this something else you stand for everyday.
