## Film and TV
### Black British cinema
In starting to research black British filmmakers, we've realised that we haven't watched much black British cinema. We're committed to changing that, and will be using the resources below as a starting point.
- List of [black British filmmakers](http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/445627/).
- Films which portray [Black British experiences](https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-black-british-films).
- The [New Black Film Collective (TNBFC)](http://www.tnbfc.co.uk/) — a nationwide network of film exhibitors, educators and programmers of Black representation on screen.

### Documentaries
This is our current to watch list — all these titles are available on Netflix.

- *Explained: The Racial Wealth Gap* 
- *Time: The Kalief Browder Story*
- *13th*
- *Who Killed Malcolm X*

## Podcasts
We don't personally tend to listen to podcasts, but we're putting this placeholder section here to remind us to seek some out as another means of education. Here are a few episodes we've seen listed but haven't listened to yet:

- [Covid-19 and the Black British Community](https://blamcharity.com/our-podcast/) from BLAM Hub
- [1619](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/podcasts/1619-podcast.html) (audio series on how slavery has transformed America) from The New York Times
