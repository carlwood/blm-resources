## Where to start

This in-depth [list of antiracism resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hpub-jkm9cLzJWqZSsETqbE6tZ13Q0UbQz--vQ2avEc/preview?pru=AAABcqRsIpE*9uibTnB1bUpgGdZKJ7qPGg) has a ton of recommendations for books grouped by category, plus essays, films and more.

## What we're reading
This list is painfully short right now, but will grow as we educate ourselves further.

- *Another Day in the Death of America: A Chronicle of Ten Short Lives* by Gary Younge (read)
- *Born a Crime* by Trevor Noah (read)
- *How To Be An Antiracist* by Ibram X. Kendi (reading)
- *The New Jim Crow* by Michelle Alexander (reading)
- *Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race* by Reni Eddo-Lodge (read)

If you're in the UK and trying to source any books, check out [New Beacon Books](https://www.newbeaconbooks.com/), a black-owned bookstore, first to see if they stock it.

## Black British history
We're from the UK and we've realised our schooling was seriously lacking in black British history. Regretfully, we've never taken it upon ourselves to learn until now, but in our early efforts to change this, we've been finding the following sites useful:

- [Black Cultural Archives](https://blackculturalarchives.org/) — histories of African and Caribbean people in Britain.
- [Black History 365](https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/) — the Black History Month Magazine, featuring tons of articles on black history, arts and culture throughout the UK.
- [Black British history on record](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/black-history) — from the National Archive. In particular [this page](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/black-british-social-and-political-history-in-the-20th-century/), which contains a list of key events, organisations and legislation.

[The Black Curriculum](https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/) is an organisation working to make Black History mandatory in schools, and you can [email the Education Secretary](https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/action) to put pressure on the government to make this change.

## British Criminal Justice System

The UK Criminal Justice System (CJS) has plenty of serious systemic issues despite many believing it's ["not as bad as in the US"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn6t74KJoO8). The figures paint a clear picture:

- [Race and the criminal justice system statistics 2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/race-and-the-criminal-justice-system-statistics-2018)
- [Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic disproportionality in the Criminal Justice System in England and Wales](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/639261/bame-disproportionality-in-the-cjs.pdf)
- [The Lammy Review](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf)

Here are just a few statistics:

- Black people make up less than 4% of the UK population but 13% of the prison population.
- White people make up 59% of the London population while black people make up 12%. Yet the proportion of stop and searches is identical for both groups at 37%.
- Black defendants receive an average custodial sentence of 28 months for indictable offences. White defendents receive on average a 18.3 months sentence  (lower than all other ethnic groups).
- The Metropolitan police officers enforcing the coronavirus lockdown are more than twice as likely to issue fines to black people as to white people ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research)).
