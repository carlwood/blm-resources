## Where to start

This in-depth [list of antiracism resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hpub-jkm9cLzJWqZSsETqbE6tZ13Q0UbQz--vQ2avEc/preview?pru=AAABcqRsIpE*9uibTnB1bUpgGdZKJ7qPGg) has a ton of recommendations for books grouped by category, plus essays, films and more.

Additionally, Alijah Webb has created a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18y0_2wm85L113fVWYdgljq9uuIlmlbl3) full of black revolutionary texts from throughout history.

## What we're reading
This list is painfully short right now, but will grow as we educate ourselves further.

- *Born a Crime* by Trevor Noah (read)
- *Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging* by Afua Hirsch (bought, to read)
- *How To Be An Antiracist* by Ibram X. Kendi (reading)
- *The New Jim Crow* by Michelle Alexander (reading)
- *Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race* by Reni Eddo-Lodge (read)

If you're in the UK and trying to source any books, check out [New Beacon Books](https://www.newbeaconbooks.com/), a black-owned bookstore, first to see if they stock it. 

## Black British history
We're from the UK and we've realised our schooling was seriously lacking in black British history. Regretfully, we've never taken it upon ourselves to fill in the gaps until now, but we've been finding the following sites useful in our early efforts to change this:

- [Black Cultural Archives](https://blackculturalarchives.org/) — histories of African and Caribbean people in Britain.
- [Black History 365](https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/) — the Black History Month Magazine, featuring tons of articles on black history, arts and culture throughout the UK.
- [Black British history on record](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/black-history) — from the National Archive. In particular [this page](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/black-british-social-and-political-history-in-the-20th-century/), which contains a list of key events, organisations and legislation.

[The Black Curriculum](https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/) is an organisation working to make Black History mandatory in schools, and you can [email the Education Secretary](https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/action) to put pressure on the government to make this change.

## British Criminal Justice System
It's plain to see that the UK Criminal Justice System (CJS) is institutionally racist, despite many believing it's "[not as bad as in the US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn6t74KJoO8)". In addition to horrifying individual cases like that of [Sarah Reed](https://www.inquest.org.uk/sarah-reed-inquest-conclusions) and [Daniel Adowole](https://www.inquest.org.uk/daniel-adewole-conclusion), the figures paint a clear picture:

- [Race and the criminal justice system statistics 2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/race-and-the-criminal-justice-system-statistics-2018)
- [Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic disproportionality in the Criminal Justice System in England and Wales](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/639261/bame-disproportionality-in-the-cjs.pdf)
- [The Lammy Review](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf)

For instance:

- Black people make up less than 4% of the UK population but 13% of the prison population.
- White people make up 59% of the London population while black people make up 12%. Yet the proportion of stop and searches is identical for both groups at 37%.
- Black defendants receive an average custodial sentence of 28 months for indictable offences. The average for white defendants is 18.3 months (lower than all other ethnic groups).
- The Metropolitan police officers enforcing the coronavirus lockdown are [more than twice as likely](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research) to issue fines to black people as to white people.

But the CJS is just one of many systems set up by white people in such a way as to benefit white people at the expense of non-white people. We want to learn why and how this happens, and how it can be reversed.

## US Criminal Justice System
We have much to learn about this but we found Michelle Alexander's *[The future of race in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ6H-Mz6hgw)* TEDx talk to be incredibly illuminating as a starting point. 

## Racial wealth gap
We recently watched *Explained: The Racial Wealth Gap* on Netlfix and found it extremely eye-opening (and shocking that we had never previously heard about redlining, for instance). Although it focuses on American history and economics, it gives an insight into the devastating effects of years of racist policy. It's [available in full on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqrhn8khGLM) if you don't have Netflix.

## Educating others
Part of the work of becoming antiracist is to challenge racism wherever you see it, and this includes having uncomfortable conversations with people you know and love. Here are a few resources we've come across to help prepare for these conversations:

- [How to respond to common racist statements](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBBTQ7kgT1S/)
- [Tips for effectively educating people who have racial biases](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBCA6o0J9tW/)
- [How to talk to your family about racism](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA-eKNfpmJu/)
