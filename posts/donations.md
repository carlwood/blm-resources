Like a lot of other people, our first donation was to the [Minnesota Freedom Fund](https://minnesotafreedomfund.org/), as it was one of the higher profile bail funds that got shared on social media. Unsurprisingly, they've been inundated with donations while many other funds are still in urgent need of support. Here are some other organisations doing valuable work.

## More ways to support

- Make your donation a regular, ongoing one to ensure these causes get the support they need beyond the times of viral outrage.
- Check out the other suggested actions on the organisation's website, for instance whether you can sign a petition or email a government official on their behalf in support of their cause (in addition to donating).
- Donate without spending money by [watching this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCgLa25fDHM) and letting all the ads play. As the video description explains: "100% of the advertisement revenue this video makes through AdSense will be donated to the associations that offer protester bail funds, help pay for family funerals, and advocacy listed in the beginning of the video." 
- If you have a birthday coming up, consider asking friends and family to donate to a relevant charity on your behalf.
- Join the Patreons of your favourite POC activists and content creators and support the work they're doing.
- Support black-owned businesses. There are many comprehensive and well-informed lists being shared around Instagram, and listing sites like [Shoppe Black](https://shoppeblack.us/) that you can use to research options.
- Boycott businesses that don't stand in solidarity with black people or have demonstrated that they are racist in their ethics and practices. Boycott businesses who put out a message of solidarity that doesn't match up with their actions the rest of the time.
- Donate your time. Obviously all of us who can should be staying at home as much as possible right now to keep vulnerable people safe during this pandemic ([which disproportionately affects people of colour](https://hbr.org/2020/05/the-disproportionate-impact-of-covid-19-on-black-health-care-workers-in-the-u-s)), but there may still be ways you can offer your skills and expertise from home. Consider reaching out to charities and non-profit organisations, particularly local and grassroots from within your community, and asking if you can contribute your skills to help.
