## Emails to send
You can find out who your local UK MP is and look at their voting record using the [They Work For You](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/) website, use the [Write To Them](https://www.writetothem.com/) website to contact them directly. Here are some ideas to get you started: 

- [Email Secretary of Education Gavin Williamson](mailto:gavin.williamson.mp@parliament.uk) and ask him to make black history mandatory in the UK national curriculum. If you're not sure what to say, you can adapt [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XHz8NJph6laVBFnuzhIzAzFTqjjfFt4-ucEt9EO6_Fw/edit) from [The Black Curriculum](https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/).
