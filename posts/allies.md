Here are of the things I've been discovering as a white person learning how to be antiracist. Most of this has come from listening to black creators and activists (especially on Instagram), and I've cited them wherever applicable so you can check them out directly:

- Nice does not equal antiracist. ([@rachel.cargle](https://www.instagram.com/rachel.cargle/))
- Staying silent means you're siding with the oppressor, whether you believe you are or not.
- If it's a choice between not doing it at all and getting it wrong. Get it wrong. Learn from it. Do better next time. ([@officialmillennialblack](https://www.instagram.com/officialmillennialblack/))
- You don't have to pretend to be free of racism to be an anti-racist. Anti-racism is the commitment to fight racism wherever you find it, including in yourself. ([@IjeomaOluo](https://twitter.com/ijeomaoluo/status/1150565193832943617?lang=en))

I really recommend watching [@ivirlei's](https://www.instagram.com/ivirlei/) IGTV *White Women who Truly Want to Help: Here's how*. Here are some of my key takeaways from it (but please watch her video):

- **Our work needs to start with deep self-reflection.** Before we can take meaningful action, we need to have the difficult conversations with ourselves, and ask: "If I'm only just now realising that I need to take action, then what have I been ignoring up until now? What are the parts of myself that have supported racism?" This work will be uncomfortable and it's a process that can take years or a lifetime, but it's *critical*. 
- **Our action needs to begin at home.** We need to commit to being the very vocal white friend and family member, who calls out racism wherever we see it. This isn't an easy position to take, so we need to get comfortable being uncomfortable. We can't let fear or discomfort stop us. We need to create a new identity for ourselves as someone who will never allow racist comments or behaviour to go unchallenged. 
- **We need to do things beyond simply educate ourselves.** By all means we should read books and watch documentaries, but if we're not actively applying any of it in the real world, it's not enough. Stand up for people. If you think "Who am I to try and make a difference?", who aren't you?! You have a voice and influence. Talk to people. Raise your children to not be passive when it comes to racism.

On the point of self-reflection, I realise the flurry of action I've taken over the past week (including reading books, sharing posts, donating, signing petitions, and even creating this site) is very likely a form of distraction so that I don't have to face the discomfort I feel as a result of not having done these things before now. I recognise that there's much work I need to do. 

And on that topic, I really recommend watching [@brandonkgood's](https://www.instagram.com/brandonkgood/) IGTV *To My White Friends: Guilt, Shame, Embarrassment*. Again, here's a summary of some of what he says, but please watch his video: 

- **The embarrassment, guilt and shame is connected to our identity as a "good person".** We consider ourselves to be kind, loving and empathetic, and if those things are true, how could we have gone this long without actively challenging racism? We're feeling discomfort because we realise that, through our silence and inaction, we have been supporting and perpetuating racism. We're now seeing that we are in fact racist, and our identity as a good person is being challenged as a result.
- **Understand that being an ally is messy and complicated.** It's natural that these negative feelings will come up, but it's what we do with them that counts. We need to connect with white friends and family and talk about it openly, and ask "how the fuck did it take us this long to wake up?" We must not unload this onto the black people in our lives. It is not for them to comfort us, or ease our guilt.
- **Feeling this way is an essential part of the work.** We need to sit with it and reflect deeply. We need to force ourselves to confront all the times we thought or did something racist. All the times we made assumptions about people based on racial stereoytpes. All the times we were silent and didn't challenge racism. And then, we need to do better.

### A note on social media use

Here are a few more tips specifically for using social media more effectively as an antiracist. I wrote these as reminders for myself first and foremost.

- Do your research before taking action, and make sure you're not causing inadvertent harm (like with the #blacklivesmatter "don't break the chain" story or the Black Out Tuesday posts on Instagram). See what black people are saying about it first, and don't do something because it's trending if it doesn't actually help black people in any meaningful way.
- Consider who you're amplifying. There are lots of well-intentioned non-black people sharing useful links or quotes from black people, but rather than re-post these second-hand sources, take the time to seek out the original source and amplify that instead.
- Ask yourself if your post is actually helping the cause, or if it's more to alleviate your own guilt and make you look like a good person. Posting about how heartbroken you are doesn't help black people.
- By all means post publicly, but you should be doing at least as much work if not much more offline. Reading, listening, self-reflecting. Aim to do more learning than talking.
- Diversify who you're following and pay attention to what they share â€” this is a change you can bed into your everyday life, and help keep antiracism at the forefront of your mind even after the murder of George Floyd is no longer something people are talking about everyday. This is now a life-long mission.
- Go back to sharing your "regular" type of content if you wish, but make antiracism a part of it. Allow it to infuse everything you do and become part of your identity. If you post vegan food content, make an effort to seek out recipes from black creators, and source ingredients from black owned businesses. If you run a fashion account, only support brands who are demonstrate a commitment to being antiracist with their actions, and publicly denounce the companies who don't. You likely stood for something before this. Now make this something else you stand for everyday.
